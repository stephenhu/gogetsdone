# task

tasks will not be limited to 140, but should have some limit close to 140,
the reasoning is we want tasks to be short, if they're too long, the implication
is to break them down into multiple tasks.

## usernames

1.  all lowercase
1.  characters a-z, 0-9, hyphen, underscore, dot
1.  must start with a-z
1.  length cannot exceed 15 chars

multiple user mentions means that the task is cloned.  however, changes to any
of the clones does not change the original task.

need to accommodate for lists/groups for usernames.

## hashtags

1.  all lowercase
1.  characters: a-z, 0-9
1.  must start with a-z
1.  length cannot exceed 32 chars

## retweet/retask

retask, this is a cloning action.

## embedded urls

need some shortener service
